#### Surg100_oct1

Generation of pseudolabels of first 100 images, using a pretrained RetinaNet model

#### Surg100test_vfnet_oct4

Fine-tuning a VFnet model for subsequent use for inference.  Reached mAP of 0.6, however, 
visually, predictions were not good --> do not use.

Proceed with Surg200 inference using:

option a)  Direct roboflow upload of images, use label assist,
option b)  2nd iteration of inference using pretrained VFNet
